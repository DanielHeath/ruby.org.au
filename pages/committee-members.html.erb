      %p Ben funds his love of good food (at home) and sake (in bars) by designing sophisticated web applications using standards-based technology. More than anything else, he is driven by a maniacal desire to produce not only elegant code, but also beautiful software in the hands of its users. He's also a committee member of Ruby Australia and joined the W3C CSS Working group as an 'invited expert' in December 2011. Otherwise, he runs <a href="http://theint.ro">The Intro</a>, which he runs to facilitate affordable, professional web focused events that would not exist otherwise.
